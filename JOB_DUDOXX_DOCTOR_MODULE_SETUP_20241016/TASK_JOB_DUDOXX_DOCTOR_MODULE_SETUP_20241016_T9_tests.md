# Task 9: Develop Unit Tests

## Objective
Validate all model methods, views, and widgets through unit tests.

## Steps Completed

1. Created `test_doctor_profile.py` file in the `tests` directory for testing the doctor profile model.
2. Created `test_api_key.py` file in the `tests` directory for testing the API key model.
3. Implemented unit tests for both models, covering:
   - Model creation
   - Field computations
   - Status transitions
   - Constraints
   - API key generation and validation

## File Contents

### tests/test_doctor_profile.py
```python
[Content of test_doctor_profile.py file]
```

### tests/test_api_key.py
```python
[Content of test_api_key.py file]
```

## Result
Unit tests have been successfully implemented for both the doctor profile and API key models:

For the doctor profile model:
- Test creation of a doctor profile
- Test the `name_get` method
- Test status transitions (activate, deactivate, retire)
- Test constraints on experience years and email format

For the API key model:
- Test creation of an API key
- Test the API key generation method
- Test the key validation method for valid, expired, and revoked keys
- Test the key regeneration method

These tests cover the core functionality of both models and will help ensure the reliability and correctness of the module as it's developed and maintained.

## Next Steps
Proceed with Task 10: Documentation and README Update.
