# Task 5: Implement Custom Widgets for Profile and Key Status

## Objective
Enhance the interface with widgets for displaying API key status and activity.

## Steps Completed

1. Created `dudoxx_doctor_widgets.js` file in the `static/src/js` directory.
2. Implemented two custom widgets:
   - StatusBadgeWidget: for displaying doctor status (active/inactive)
   - ApiKeyStatusWidget: for displaying API key status (active/revoked/expired)
3. Updated `dudoxx_doctor_views.xml` to use these custom widgets in form and tree views.
4. Updated `__manifest__.py` to include the new JavaScript file in assets.

## File Contents

### static/src/js/dudoxx_doctor_widgets.js
```javascript
[Content of dudoxx_doctor_widgets.js file]
```

### views/dudoxx_doctor_views.xml (updated)
```xml
[Content of dudoxx_doctor_views.xml file]
```

### __manifest__.py (updated)
```python
[Content of __manifest__.py file]
```

## Result
Custom widgets have been successfully implemented to enhance the user interface:
- The StatusBadgeWidget displays the doctor's status as a colored badge (green for active, red for inactive).
- The ApiKeyStatusWidget displays the API key status as a colored badge (green for active, red for revoked, yellow for expired).
- These widgets are now used in both form and tree views for doctor profiles and API keys.
- The widgets provide a more visual and intuitive representation of status information.

## Next Steps
Proceed with Task 6: Custom CSS Styling.
