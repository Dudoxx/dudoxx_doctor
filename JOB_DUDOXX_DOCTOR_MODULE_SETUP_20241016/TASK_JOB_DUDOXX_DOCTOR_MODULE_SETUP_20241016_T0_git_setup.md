# Task 0: Git Repository Setup

## Objective
Initialize a Git repository for the `dudoxx_doctor` module and set up the main branch.

## Steps Completed

1. Created the `dudoxx_doctor` directory.
2. Initialized a Git repository inside the `dudoxx_doctor` directory.
3. Created a README.md file with a brief description of the module.
4. Created a .gitignore file for Odoo and Python projects.
5. Made initial commits for README.md and .gitignore.
6. Created a GitHub repository under the Dudoxx organization using the `gh` CLI tool.
7. Pushed the initial setup to GitHub.

## Commands Used

```bash
# Create directory and initialize Git repository
mkdir -p dudoxx_doctor && cd dudoxx_doctor && git init

# Create README.md and make initial commit
echo "# dudoxx_doctor\n\nOdoo 16 module for managing doctor profiles and API keys." > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README.md"

# Add .gitignore file and commit
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore file for Odoo and Python"

# Create GitHub repository and push
gh repo create Dudoxx/dudoxx_doctor --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
